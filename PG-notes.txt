Before 
- Forking processes for each connection (safer):
    -> Prevents one client from crashing the entire database
    -> less overhead between forking a process and creating a thread (in Linux)
    -> moving to a multithread architecture will require to extensive rewriting

Problem
- Clients tend to open multiple connections
- Forking fast transactions become expensive 

Pool vs Client
